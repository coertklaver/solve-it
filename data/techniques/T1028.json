    "details": "With the 'Chip-off' method, the chip(s) of interest is/are physically removed from a PCB. If it is a Non-Volatile memory chip, this chip can be subsequently read with a suitable memory chip reader, see:\\nT1029: Data read from desoldered managed NAND\\nT1030: Data read from raw NAND\\nComponents (for instance Non-Volatile memory chips) in modern electronics are soldered to the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with a tin (Sn) alloy. The chip can be extracted by heating or by mechanical techniques. These are separate techniques, with their own particular weaknesses.",
    "subtechniques": [],
    "examples": ["Chip-off can be used when data stored in a non-volatile (NV) memory chip can not be accessed through any other (non destructive) methode.\\nChip-off can be used to repair a damaged device. All essential components (often: NV Memory, Processor and security element) can be transplanted to a donor device."],
