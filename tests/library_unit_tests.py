Unit Tests for SOLVE-IT Library

This test suite provides extensive coverage of the solve_it_library.KnowledgeBase class,
testing all major functionality including:

- Basic library initialization and data loading
- Core retrieval methods (get_technique, get_weakness, get_mitigation)
- List methods for all entity types
- Objective mapping functionality
- Relationship traversal methods
- Bulk data retrieval methods
- Advanced features (search, mitigation analysis)
- Error handling with invalid inputs

Note: Some tests include logging output (warnings) which are expected behavior
when testing error handling with non-existent IDs.
